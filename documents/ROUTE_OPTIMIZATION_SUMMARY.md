- Location: Colombo, Sri Lanka
- Zoom Level: 13

### Customization
To change the default location, modify in `page.tsx`:
```typescript
const mapCenter = useMemo<[number, number]>(() => {
  if (optimizedRoute.length === 0) {
    return [YOUR_LAT, YOUR_LNG]; // Change here
  }
  // ... rest of code
}, [optimizedRoute]);
```

## 🔍 Algorithm Explanation

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialization**
   ```
   - Create empty optimizedRoute array
   - Copy all bins to unvisitedBins array
   ```

2. **Start Point**
   ```
   - Take first bin from unvisitedBins
   - Add to optimizedRoute
   - Remove from unvisitedBins
   ```

3. **Iteration** (while unvisitedBins not empty)
   ```
   - Get last bin in optimizedRoute as current
   - For each bin in unvisitedBins:
     - Calculate distance to current
   - Find bin with minimum distance
   - Add nearest bin to optimizedRoute
   - Remove from unvisitedBins
   ```

4. **Result**
   ```
   - optimizedRoute contains bins in order
   - Assign sequential stop numbers
   - Return formatted response
   ```

### Distance Formula
```javascript
distance = √[(lat₁ - lat₂)² + (lon₁ - lon₂)²]
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Current Implementation
- **Best for:** 1-1000 bins
- **Algorithm:** Nearest Neighbor (greedy)
- **Optimization:** ~70-80% of optimal
- **Speed:** Fast, real-time results

### Future Improvements
- Haversine formula for geographic accuracy
- 2-opt algorithm for better optimization
- Genetic algorithm for large datasets
- Road network integration
- Traffic-aware routing

## 🛡️ Security & Access Control

- ✅ Requires authentication (Manager or Admin role)
- ✅ Uses existing auth middleware
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed
- ✅ Input validation on coordinates
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes

---

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)

**Note:** Requires JavaScript enabled for map functionality.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Distance Calculation:** Uses Euclidean distance (straight line)
   - Real-world roads may differ
   - Consider Haversine formula for production

2. **Algorithm:** Greedy approach (Nearest Neighbor)
   - Not always optimal solution
   - Good enough for most cases (~70-80% optimal)

3. **Scalability:** O(n²) complexity
   - Works well up to ~1000 bins
   - Consider advanced algorithms for larger datasets

4. **Map:** Requires internet for tiles
   - OpenStreetMap tiles load from external server
   - Consider offline tile server for production
